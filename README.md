# Brick_Bracking-Game-In-Python
This type of game can be implemented in Python using the Pygame library, which provides functions for creating graphics, handling user input, and playing sounds. The game loop would involve constantly moving the ball and paddle based on user input, detecting collisions with the bricks and paddle, and updating the score and lives as necessary.
